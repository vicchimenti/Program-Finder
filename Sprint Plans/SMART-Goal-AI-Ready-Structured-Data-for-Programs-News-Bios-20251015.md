## Description
Seattle University’s search performance continues to improve, positioning the university as a rising authority in higher education search results. To build on this foundation, I will lead the implementation of **Schema.org structured data** across key content areas — **Programs**, **News**, and **Faculty Bios** — to prepare our site for inclusion in **Google AI Overviews** and other AI-driven results.

This work ensures our site content is machine-readable, discoverable, and eligible for enhanced display. While Google adoption timelines vary, structured data is the foundation for future visibility. The goal is to complete all technical work and validation so the university is ready when search systems expand AI-based results.

---

## SMART Goal Statement
By **Winter Quarter 2026**, complete design, development, and validation of structured data for all **program, news, and faculty bio pages**, following **Schema.org** standards. The deliverable will make Seattle University **AI-Overview ready** and strengthen our authority in search results.

---

## Specific
- Add **Schema.org Microdata** for:
  - `EducationalOccupationalProgram` (academic programs)  
  - `NewsArticle` (news stories)  
  - `Person` (faculty bios)
- Include nested `CollegeOrUniversity` provider metadata.
- Add hidden `FAQPage` and `ItemList` schema for context.  
- Keep existing meta, OG, and Funnelback tags intact.  
- Validate via **Google Search Console** and **Schema Markup Validator**.

---

## Measurable
- Establish **Q1 2025 baseline** using Google Search Console “Enhancements.”  
- Target: **100% valid detections** for `EducationalOccupationalProgram`, `Person`, and `FAQPage` by Q2 2026.  
- Expect a **10–15% increase** in organic impressions and CTR.  
- Validate no schema errors or warnings sitewide.  
- Maintain tracking in quarterly reports.

**Sample Progress Table**

| Quarter | Schema Type | Valid | Invalid | Notes |
|----------|--------------|--------|----------|--------|
| Q1 2025 | FAQPage | 1 | 2 | Baseline |
| Q4 2025 | Program | 50 | 0 | Program schema complete |
