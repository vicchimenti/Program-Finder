**Owner:** Victor Chimenti – Senior Manager of Web Development  
**Department:** Marketing & Communications  
**Review Period:** November 2025 – February 2026

## Description
To support Seattle University’s AI Overviews and structured data readiness, I will create the **first-draft content for two unique FAQs per academic program** using the official **Program Source Excel file** as the data foundation. Using **AI tools such as ChatGPT and Claude**, I will generate questions and initial draft answers that align with student intent, program outcomes, and search trends. These drafts will serve as a foundation for the **Web Strategy group**, who will review and refine them for publication.

This work contributes directly to the university’s broader **AI-Ready Structured Data project**, ensuring each program page has meaningful, machine-readable FAQ content for future inclusion in search enhancements.

## SMART Goal Statement
Between **November 1, 2025, and February 1, 2026**, I will research and create the **first-draft version of two unique FAQs** for each of Seattle University’s **167 academic programs**, producing a total of **334 original entries** for editorial review.
